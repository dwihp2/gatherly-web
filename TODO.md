## Architecture Notes

### Folder Structure Rules
- **Features**: Located under `/src/app/[feature-name]/` following Next.js App Router
- **Global Utilities**: Located under `/src/lib/`, `/src/components/ui/`, `/src/stores/`
- **Clean Architecture Layers** (within each feature):
  - `view/` - UI components (Container + Presentation)
  - `usecases/` - Business logic hooks
  - `repositories/` - Data access layer
  - `models/` - Types, interfaces, and schemas

### Current Status
Working on cleaning up previous implementation and setting up correct architecture structure.

## Next Steps
1. Clean up incorrect previous implementation
2. Set up proper folder structure under `/src/app`
3. Create core shared utilities
4. Start with landing page implementation
