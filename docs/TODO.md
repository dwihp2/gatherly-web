The immediate focus must be completing the customer purchase flow to achieve a functional MVP that serves both organizers and attendees.

## Next Steps
**Current Status**: üö® **CRITICAL ROUTE FIXES** - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix broken dashboard navigation routes before any other development work. The application currently has multiple 404 errors that make it unusable for organizers.

**Priority Order**:
1. **Day 1**: Fix `/dashboard/events` route and sidebar event count badge
2. **Day 2**: Create event detail view and fix check-in navigation  
3. **Day 3**: Implement analytics and settings routes
4. **Day 4**: Create QR scanner dashboard
5. **Week 2**: Begin customer purchase flow (once organizer dashboard is stable)

**Success Criteria**: 
- All sidebar navigation links work without 404 errors
- Event counts show real data throughout the interface  
- Users can view individual event details
- Complete organizer dashboard functionality restored

**Critical Dependency**: Customer-facing features **CANNOT** be developed until these core organizer routes are functional. The broken navigation creates a poor user experience and blocks proper testing of the overall platform.

## üìä **UPDATED ASSESSMENT SUMMARY**

### Previous Status (INCORRECT)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard: "COMPLETE with all planned features"  
- ‚úÖ Event Management: "COMPLETE with comprehensive modal system"
- üìà Overall MVP: "~40% complete"

### Actual Status (CORRECTED)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard: "PARTIALLY BROKEN - core navigation broken"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Event Management: "PARTIALLY COMPLETE - missing view/detail routes"  
- üìâ Overall MVP: "~25% complete" (reduced due to critical issues)

### Key Discovery
The previous assessment was **overly optimistic** and missed critical navigation issues that significantly impact user experience. A thorough audit revealed multiple broken routes that prevent proper organizer workflow completion.

**Lesson**: Always test full user journeys, not just individual components, to ensure complete functionality.
