## 🏗️ Architecture Status

### ✅ Current Architecture Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns maintained
- **Type Safety**: Zero `any` types, comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Multi-tenancy**: Full organization-based data isolation
- **Component System**: Shadcn/UI integration with enhanced FormLabel
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + Zustand working effectively
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design throughout organizer interface

### 🔧 Technical Debt to Address
- **DataTable Upgrade**: Basic tables should be upgraded to professional DataTable
- **Error Boundaries**: Need comprehensive error handling for customer flows
- **Loading States**: Customer pages need skeleton loading components
- **SEO Optimization**: Public event pages need meta tags and structured data
- **Performance**: Image optimization and bundle splitting for customer pages

## 🎯 Long-term Vision (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2: Pro Features (Months 2-3)
- Advanced analytics and reporting with enhanced DataTables
- Multiple ticket tiers and discount codes
- Custom branding and white-label options
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced payment methods (installments, etc.)

### Phase 3: Platform Scaling (Months 4-6)
- Mobile app for organizers and attendees
- Advanced anti-fraud and security features
- Seat mapping for venue events
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Advanced marketing tools and automation

The immediate focus must be completing the customer purchase flow to achieve a functional MVP that serves both organizers and attendees.

## Next Steps
**Current Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL ROUTE FIXES** - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix broken dashboard navigation routes before any other development work. The application currently has multiple 404 errors that make it unusable for organizers.

**Priority Order**:
1. **Day 1**: Fix `/dashboard/events` route and sidebar event count badge
2. **Day 2**: Create event detail view and fix check-in navigation  
3. **Day 3**: Implement analytics and settings routes
4. **Day 4**: Create QR scanner dashboard
5. **Week 2**: Begin customer purchase flow (once organizer dashboard is stable)

**Success Criteria**: 
- All sidebar navigation links work without 404 errors
- Event counts show real data throughout the interface  
- Users can view individual event details
- Complete organizer dashboard functionality restored

**Critical Dependency**: Customer-facing features **CANNOT** be developed until these core organizer routes are functional. The broken navigation creates a poor user experience and blocks proper testing of the overall platform.

## 📊 **UPDATED ASSESSMENT SUMMARY**

### Previous Status (INCORRECT)
- ✅ Dashboard: "COMPLETE with all planned features"  
- ✅ Event Management: "COMPLETE with comprehensive modal system"
- 📈 Overall MVP: "~40% complete"

### Actual Status (CORRECTED)
- ⚠️ Dashboard: "PARTIALLY BROKEN - core navigation broken"
- ⚠️ Event Management: "PARTIALLY COMPLETE - missing view/detail routes"  
- 📉 Overall MVP: "~25% complete" (reduced due to critical issues)

### Key Discovery
The previous assessment was **overly optimistic** and missed critical navigation issues that significantly impact user experience. A thorough audit revealed multiple broken routes that prevent proper organizer workflow completion.

**Lesson**: Always test full user journeys, not just individual components, to ensure complete functionality.
