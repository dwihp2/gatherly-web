## Architecture Notes

### Current Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Authentication system with Better Auth and organization plugin
✅ **COMPLETED**: Clean Architecture structure with proper folder organization
✅ **COMPLETED**: Landing page with all sections from UX Structure Plan
✅ **COMPLETED**: Full organizer dashboard matching UX Structure Plan exactly
✅ **COMPLETED**: Dashboard navigation with user profile management
✅ **COMPLETED**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
✅ **COMPLETED**: Suspense boundaries for Next.js 15 compatibility

### Folder Structure
- **Features**: Located under `/src/app/[feature-name]/` following Next.js App Router
- **Global Utilities**: Located under `/src/lib/`, `/src/components/ui/`, `/src/stores/`
- **Clean Architecture Layers** (within each feature):
  - `view/` - UI components (Container + Presentation)
  - `usecases/` - Business logic hooks
  - `repositories/` - Data access layer
  - `models/` - Types, interfaces, and schemas

### Multi-tenancy Implementation
- Every data table includes `organizationId` for tenant isolation
- Session management includes organization context
- All queries automatically filter by organization
- User creation automatically creates organization
- Ready for SaaS scaling

## Next Steps
The application now has a fully functional authentication system and a complete organizer dashboard that matches the UX Structure Plan exactly. The next major milestone is implementing the Event Management System, starting with the Create Event modal.
