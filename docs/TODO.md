### ✅ URL Slug Generation Compliance Fix - **COMPLETED** ✅
**Goal**: Fix slug generation to comply with PublicationSettingsSchema validation rules
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created centralized slug utility and updated all components

#### Problem Analysis
The current slug generation in multiple locations did not properly comply with the `PublicationSettingsSchema` regex pattern:
- **Pattern Required**: `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/` (only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens)
- **Length**: Minimum 3 characters, maximum 100 characters
- **Previous Issues**:
  - Edit page used simple `.replace(/\s+/g, '-')` which didn't handle special characters
  - PublicationSettingsForm had better logic but may still generate invalid slugs
  - No consistent slug generation utility across the application

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] **Create Centralized Slug Generation Utility** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Create `src/lib/utils/slug.ts` with `generateSlug()` function
  - [x] Implement proper character filtering (remove all non a-z0-9 characters)
  - [x] Handle consecutive hyphens (replace multiple hyphens with single)
  - [x] Trim leading/trailing hyphens
  - [x] Ensure length constraints (3-100 characters)
  - [x] Add fallback logic for edge cases (empty result, too short)
  - [x] Add `isValidSlug()` validation function
  - [x] **FIXED**: Handle apostrophes and special characters properly
  - [x] **FIXED**: Add Unicode normalization for diacritics (café → cafe)
  - [x] **VERIFIED**: 100% compliance with regex `/^[a-z0-9-]+$/`

- [x] **Update Form Components** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Replace inline slug generation in `PublicationSettingsForm.tsx`
  - [x] Use centralized `generateSlug()` utility
  - [x] Ensure generated slugs always pass Zod validation

- [x] **Fix Edit Page Slug Generation** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Replace simple slug generation in `src/app/events/[eventId]/edit/page.tsx`
  - [x] Use the same centralized `generateSlug()` utility
  - [x] Ensure consistency across create and edit flows

- [x] **Add Slug Validation Testing** ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Create comprehensive test script with 18+ test cases
  - [x] Test edge cases: special characters, unicode, empty strings, apostrophes
  - [x] Test specific user case: "Dwi's Tech Meetup Jakarta 2025" → "dwis-tech-meetup-jakarta-2025"
  - [x] Verify schema compliance for all generated slugs
  - [x] Test both manual and auto-generated slug scenarios
  - [x] All tests pass with 100% schema compliance

### ✅ FormLabel Required Field Enhancement - **COMPLETED** ✅
**Goal**: Improve form label consistency and accessibility for required fields
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced FormLabel component with `required` prop

#### Benefits Achieved
- **Consistency**: All required indicators use the same styling (`text-destructive`)
- **Accessibility**: Automatic ARIA label (`aria-label="required"`) for screen readers
- **Maintainability**: Centralized logic for required field styling
- **Flexibility**: Easy to toggle required state programmatically
- **Clean Code**: Removes clutter from form labels, making them more readable

## 🎯 Current Status Summary

### What Works Now ✅
- **Full organizer experience**: Sign up → Create events → Manage dashboard
- **Professional SaaS interface**: Landing page, authentication, dashboard
- **Complete event management**: Create, edit, delete, status management  
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Organization-based data isolation
- **Production-ready build**: Zero TypeScript errors, optimized bundle

### What's Missing 🚧
- **Customer-facing pages**: No way for attendees to discover or purchase tickets
- **Payment processing**: No transaction capability
- **E-ticket system**: No ticket generation or delivery
- **QR scanner**: No check-in functionality for event day

### MVP Completion Progress
- **Organizer Side**: 95% complete (just needs DataTable upgrade)
- **Customer Side**: 10% complete (basic structure only)
- **Payment & Tickets**: 5% complete (infrastructure planning only)
- **Overall MVP**: ~40% complete

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

### This Week's Focus - **Customer Purchase Flow**
The absolute priority is completing the customer-facing side of the platform. Currently, Gatherly is only 40% of a complete MVP because customers cannot discover or purchase tickets.

#### Day 1-2: Public Event Pages
1. Create event discovery/browse page
2. Build event detail pages with full information display
3. Implement social sharing for events

#### Day 3-4: Purchase Flow
1. Ticket selection interface with real-time inventory
2. Customer checkout form with Indonesian localization
3. Order confirmation and cart management

#### Day 5-7: Payment & E-Tickets
1. Payment gateway abstraction and mock implementation
2. QR code generation and PDF ticket creation
3. Email/WhatsApp delivery system

### Success Metrics for Next Phase
- **Customer Activation**: Customers can discover and purchase tickets end-to-end
- **Transaction Completion**: Mock payment flow works completely
- **Ticket Delivery**: Generated tickets are delivered via email/WhatsApp
- **Mobile Experience**: Full customer flow optimized for mobile devices

## 🏗️ Architecture Status

### ✅ Current Architecture Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns maintained
- **Type Safety**: Zero `any` types, comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Multi-tenancy**: Full organization-based data isolation
- **Component System**: Shadcn/UI integration with enhanced FormLabel
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + Zustand working effectively
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design throughout organizer interface

### 🔧 Technical Debt to Address
- **DataTable Upgrade**: Basic tables should be upgraded to professional DataTable
- **Error Boundaries**: Need comprehensive error handling for customer flows
- **Loading States**: Customer pages need skeleton loading components
- **SEO Optimization**: Public event pages need meta tags and structured data
- **Performance**: Image optimization and bundle splitting for customer pages

## 🎯 Long-term Vision (Post-MVP)

### Phase 2: Pro Features (Months 2-3)
- Advanced analytics and reporting with enhanced DataTables
- Multiple ticket tiers and discount codes
- Custom branding and white-label options
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced payment methods (installments, etc.)

### Phase 3: Platform Scaling (Months 4-6)
- Mobile app for organizers and attendees
- Advanced anti-fraud and security features
- Seat mapping for venue events
- WhatsApp Business API integration
- Advanced marketing tools and automation

The immediate focus must be completing the customer purchase flow to achieve a functional MVP that serves both organizers and attendees.

## Next Steps
**Current Status**: Public Event Pages & Customer Purchase Flow - NEWLY PRIORITIZED 🆕

**Immediate Action Required**: Begin implementation of customer-facing event discovery and ticket purchase system. This is the critical missing piece that will transform Gatherly from a 40% complete project to a fully functional MVP.

The application currently has excellent organizer tools but no customer experience. Completing the public event pages and purchase flow will:
- Enable end-to-end event ticketing functionality
- Provide a complete MVP ready for market validation
- Allow testing of the full user journey from event creation to ticket purchase
- Establish the foundation for payment integration and e-ticket delivery

**Success Criteria**: By next week, customers should be able to browse events, select tickets, complete checkout, and receive confirmation - completing the core MVP functionality.
